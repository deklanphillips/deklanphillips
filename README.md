### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Deklan**](https://deklanphillips.github.io/portfolio/), a program manager and product development leader based in Los Angeles.

I currently work at [**@Centr**](https://www.centr.com/), where I lead new product development launches including equipment for **Hyrox competitions**, **consumer treadmills**, and more. Previously, I launched key programs at [**@Tesla**](https://www.tesla.com), including the **Cyber Battery**, **Model Y Refresh**, and **Model 3 Performance**.

I'm passionate about creating high-impact products and streamlining development processes. I've implemented tools like **Asana**, **Jira**, and **Confluence** to scale execution and improve collaboration across cross-functional teams.
